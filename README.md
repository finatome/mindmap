  root((Black–Scholes Theorem))
    "1️⃣ Core Idea"
      "Fair price of a European option under no arbitrage"
      "Key Formula: V = S N(d₁) − K e^{-r(T−t)} N(d₂)"
      "Put derived via Put–Call Parity"
    "2️⃣ Foundations"
      "Underlying Dynamics: dS = μSdt + σSdW (Geometric Brownian Motion)"
      "Market Assumptions"
        "Frictionless market (no costs/taxes)"
        "Constant r, σ"
        "Continuous trading"
        "No arbitrage"
        "Borrow/lend at risk-free rate"
        "No dividends"
      "Instruments"
        "Stock Sₜ"
        "Bond Bₜ = e^{rt}"
    "3️⃣ Building Blocks"
      "a) Replicating Portfolio"
        "Option ↔ Δ shares + B bond"
        "Choose Δ to eliminate risk (cancel dWₜ term)"
      "b) Self-Financing Condition"
        "Portfolio value changes only by market movement"
        "dV = Δ dS + r(B − ΔS) dt"
      "c) No-Arbitrage Argument"
        "Riskless portfolio must earn r"
        "Leads to Black–Scholes PDE"
        "Vₜ + ½σ²S²V_{SS} + rS V_S − rV = 0"
    "4️⃣ PDE Solution"
      "Boundary Condition: V(S,T) = max(S−K,0)"
      "Define:"
        "d₁ = [ln(S₀/K)+(r+½σ²)T]/(σ√T)"
        "d₂ = d₁ − σ√T"
      "Solutions:"
        "Call: C = S₀N(d₁) − K e^{−rT} N(d₂)"
        "Put:  P = K e^{−rT} N(−d₂) − S₀N(−d₁)"
    "5️⃣ Outputs"
      "Option Values (Call/Put)"
      "Greeks: Δ, Γ, Θ, Vega, ρ"
      "Hedging Ratios and Risk Measures"
    "6️⃣ Interpretations"
      "Delta Hedging: continuous risk elimination"
      "Risk-Neutral Valuation: replace μ with r"
      "Volatility as time-value driver"
      "Foundation of modern derivatives pricing"
    "7️⃣ Extensions"
      "Dividends: replace S₀ with S₀ e^{−qT}"
      "American Options: free-boundary solutions"
      "Stochastic Volatility / Jumps: Heston, Merton models"
      "Binomial Model as discrete-time precursor"
